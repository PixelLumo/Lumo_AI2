The LUMO memory system uses FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for vector embeddings.
It stores conversation history in a FAISS index for fast semantic retrieval.
Memory embeddings are 768-dimensional vectors from sentence transformers.
You can search past conversations by semantic similarity, not just keywords.
Memory is persistent in memory/conversation_history.json.
