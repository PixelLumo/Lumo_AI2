LUMO supports three main action types: web_search, save_note, and execute_action.
Destructive actions like save_note require explicit user confirmation.
Read-only actions like web_search execute immediately without confirmation.
Actions are logged with arguments and results for debugging and learning.
The action executor validates inputs and handles errors gracefully.
